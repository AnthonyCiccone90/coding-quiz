### User Story
AS A coding boot camp student
<br>
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
<br>
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
<hr>

### Description

This challenge was to create a code quiz, and a challenge indeed it was. Several criteria were required to complete this assignment. This included making time intervals, event listeners and several variables and functions. The amount of variables and functions I used for this challenge was far more than I have used thus far by a significant margin. Below is a screenshot of the starting screen before the game begins
