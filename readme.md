### User Story
AS A coding boot camp student
<br>
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
<br>
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
<hr>

### Description

This challenge was to create a code quiz, and a challenge indeed it was. Several criteria were required to complete this assignment. This included making time intervals, event listeners and several variables and functions. The amount of variables and functions I used for this challenge was far more than I have used thus far by a significant margin. Below is a screenshot of the starting screen before the game begins

### Reflection

This challenge has be the hardest for me thus far. I may start adding reflections during my time in this bootcamp (depending on the assignment). Thankfully, I have been told my README files are meaningful enough so far, but I believe it is important for me to do this since I will be the one looking back at this after the bootcamp is finished. This will be a beneficial way to track my own improvement as well as my most obvious (and subtle) strengths and weaknesses. Syntax on JavaScript and jQueries has proven to be diffucult for me to grasp right away. Just like anything else though, it's practice, practice, practice. Now more than ever I understand why Google is everyone's best friend.
